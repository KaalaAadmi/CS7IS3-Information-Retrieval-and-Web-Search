# CS7IS3-Information-Retrieval-and-Web-Search Assignment
Welcome to my GitHub repository for the CS7IS3-Information-Retrieval-and-Web-Search module at Trinity College Dublin. This repository contains the code for the assignment completed by me.

The objective of the assignment was to develop a search engine and analyze the search results using trec_eval. I implemented a search engine using Java and Elasticsearch. I used IntelliJ IDEA as my development environment to create and run the project. The search engine indexes a collection of documents and provides a ranked list of results based on the relevance of the query terms.

The repository contains the following files and folders:

- src: Java source code for the search engine implementation.
- lib: Libraries required for the project.
- trec_eval_results: Folder containing the output of running trec_eval on the search results.
- queries.txt: Text file containing a set of queries to test the search engine.
- README.md: This file.

To use the search engine, you will need to install Elasticsearch and configure it accordingly. You can then run the project in IntelliJ IDEA and use the queries.txt file to test the search engine. The trec_eval_results folder contains the output of running trec_eval on the search results.

I hope that this repository and my search engine implementation will be useful for those interested in information retrieval and web search.
